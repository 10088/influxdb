## Overview

This is an Go implementation of the Raft distributed consensus protocol.
Raft is a protocol by which a cluster of nodes can maintain a replicated state machine.
The state machine is kept in sync through the use of a replicated log.

For more details on Raft, you can read [In Search of an Understandable Consensus Algorithm](https://ramcloud.stanford.edu/wiki/download/attachments/11370504/raft.pdf) by Diego Ongaro and John Ousterhout.
